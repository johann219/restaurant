                <p>
                    Welcome, traveller, to The Trebuhovo Tavern – the heart and hearth of our 
                    living medieval ethno-village project! Nestled away from the clamor 
                    of the modern world, we invite you to step across our threshold
                    and back in time. More than just a restaurant, The Trebuhovo 
                    is an experience woven into the fabric of our village, offering a warm refuge,
                    hearty fare, and a taste of history, thoughtfully recreated for your comfort
                    and enjoyment. Sit by the fire, raise a goblet, and become part of our story.

                <h1>Serenity Over Struggle</h1>
                <p>
                    Our passion lies in capturing the spirit, not necessarily the struggle,
                    of medieval life. While history had its hardships, we choose to celebrate
                    its quieter moments: the warmth of community, the connection to the land,
                    the simple pleasure of a well-cooked meal shared in good company.
                    Our philosophy centers on providing an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.
                    We aim to be an escape, a place where you can slow down, savor the present,
                    and experience the restorative serenity inspired by a bygone era,
                    without needing to darn your own tunic!

                <h1>From Our Village & Valued Neighbours</h1>
                <p>
                    Authenticity guides our hand, right down to the ingredients on your plate.
                    We take immense pride in the provenance of our food and drink.
                    Many herbs, vegetables, and even some livestock are raised right here
                    within our ethno-village grounds, tended with traditional care.
                    What we don't produce ourselves, we source meticulously from local farmers,
                    dedicated artisans, and small, independent producers who share our commitment
                    to quality and sustainable practices. You won't find fare from
                    distant corporations here – only the honest bounty of our land and
                    the craft of our community, brought fresh to your table.
