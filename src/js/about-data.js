//     <p>
//         Our passion lies in capturing the spirit, not necessarily the struggle,
//         of medieval life. While history had its hardships, we choose to celebrate
//         its quieter moments: the warmth of community, the connection to the land,
//         the simple pleasure of a well-cooked meal shared in good company.
//         Our philosophy centers on providing an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.
//         We aim to be an escape, a place where you can slow down, savor the present,
//         and experience the restorative serenity inspired by a bygone era,
//         without needing to darn your own tunic!

//     <p>
//         Authenticity guides our hand, right down to the ingredients on your plate.
//         We take immense pride in the provenance of our food and drink.
//         Many herbs, vegetables, and even some livestock are raised right here
//         within our ethno-village grounds, tended with traditional care.
//         What we don't produce ourselves, we source meticulously from local farmers,
//         dedicated artisans, and small, independent producers who share our commitment
//         to quality and sustainable practices. You won't find fare from
//         distant corporations here – only the honest bounty of our land and
//         the craft of our community, brought fresh to your table.
